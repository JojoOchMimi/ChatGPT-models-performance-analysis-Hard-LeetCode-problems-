# ChatGPT Models LeetCode Performance Analysis

This repository contains an Excel workbook that presents the results and statistical analysis of two experiments comparing the performance of three ChatGPT models‚Äî**GPT-3.5**, **GPT-4o**, and **o1**‚Äîon solving hard LeetCode problems.

## üß™ Experiment Overview

The goal of this study was to evaluate and compare how well each model performed when solving challenging coding problems. Two types of scoring methods were applied:

- **Aggregated Approach (2-out-of-3):** A problem is considered solved if the model succeeds in at least 2 out of 3 attempts.
- **Proportional Approach:** Each problem is scored based on how many attempts were successful (0%, 33.33%, 66.67%, 100%).

Two experiments were conducted:
- **Main Experiment**: Used a benchmark problem set from Kuhail et al.
- **Post-Experiment**: Used a new problem set selected by the authors.

## üìò Workbook Structure

The Excel workbook contains the following sheets:

1. **Experiment Results by Model**  
   Shows individual results for each model in both experiments, with links to detailed results within the workbook.

2. **Unsolved Problems**  
   Summarizes which problems were not solved by each model across experiments.

3. **Pairwise P-Value Comparison**  
   Displays statistical significance between models using Wald z-tests:
   - Aggregated Approach (n = 60)
   - Proportional Approach (n = 30)

4. **Wald Confidence Intervals**  
   Includes confidence intervals for each model's performance using both scoring methods.

## üìä Metrics Included

- Pass Rate (pÃÇ)
- Standard Error (SE)
- Margin of Error
- z-value and p-value
- Wald 95% Confidence Intervals
- Statistical Significance

## üîç Key Observations

- **o1** and **GPT-4o** significantly outperformed **GPT-3.5** in both experiments.
- While **o1** slightly outperformed **GPT-4o**, the difference was not statistically significant.
- o1 and GPT-4o solved different subsets of problems, suggesting complementary strengths.
